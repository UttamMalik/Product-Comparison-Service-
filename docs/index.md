PROBLEM STATEMENT


Many customers usually are forced to visit multiple sites before buying a product. This is not usually a problem but there are times when it is very irritating and time consuming and it is difficult to remember each and every features of the product. It is also confusing to search as these websites have different interfaces so user needs to learn to use each and every interface which can be tedious.



According to a study on shopbots, “shopbots can integrate retail promotions and incorporate recommender systems in order to provide greater values to their users. Shopbots or comparison shopping agents, which are websites providing online comparison shopping services to millions of shoppers every day, have been helping reduce the search cost of price and retailer-related information on the Web, and thereby improving market efficiency”.
According to another study, “it is anticipated that sellers will come to rely on pricebots, automated agents that employ price-setting algorithms in an attempt to maximize profits”. A shopbot available at shopper.com claims to compare 1,000,000 prices on 100,000computer-oriented products. DealPilot.com (formerlyacses.com) is a shopbot that gathers, collates and sorts prices and expected delivery times of books, CDs, and movies ordered for sale on-line. One of the most popular shopbots, mysimon.com, compares office supplies, groceries, toys, apparel, and consumer electronics, just to name a few of the items on its product line. As the range of products covered by shopbots expands to include more complex products such as consumer electronics, the level of shopbot sophistication is rising accordingly. On August 16th, 1999,mysimon.comincorporated technology that, for products with multiple features such as digital cameras, uses a series of questions to elicit multi-attribute utilities from buyers, and then sorts products according to the buyer's specified utility.
